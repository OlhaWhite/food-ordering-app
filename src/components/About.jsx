His true love and aspiration was to open up a kosher dairy restaurant that everyone will enjoy. Edward who is constantly going in and out of the kitchen making sure everything is perfect and up to their standards, is also on the floor welcoming guests.  All of our dishes are made from scratch daily and our portions are generous.
